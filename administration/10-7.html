	<h3>10. Memento</h3>

		<p>In Christopher Nolan's breakout film you forget everything you think you know, or at least remember, about your memory. This is one of my favorites because of how unique it is. Leonard, played by Guy Pearce, is trying to track down the man who murdered his wife, but he has no short term memory. The movie is played in reverse chronological order, so just like Leonard, you don't know who to trust. The only difference is that you eventually learn who to trust, but Leonard never does because of his memory.</p>
	<h3>9. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h3>

		<p>In Quentin Tarantino's latest film, you get to take a look at Hollywood back in the 1960s. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt shine in this movie. DiCaprio plays Rick Dalton, an actor who rose to fame in the 50s as the lead of a western TV show. His days seem to have come and gone as an actor in Hollywood, something he struggles to come to grips with. Pitt plays his easy going stunt double Cliff Booth, who has also faded out of Hollywood, but just doesn't seem to care.</p>
	<h3>8. The Big Short</h3>

		<p>Everyone knows what happened in 2008 when the stock market crashed, but do you really know why? If you don't then I recommend watching The Big Short. This movie follows a hand full of guys who predict the market will crash years before in happens, and make big bucks off of it when it finally does. It also has an all-star cast of Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, and Brad Pitt.</p>
	<h3>7. Zero Dark Thirty</h3>

		<p>Zero Dark Thirty follows Maya, the confident CIA agent who tracks down the most wanted man in the world, Osama Bin Laden. Maya tirelessly works for years trying to find his whereabouts, sifting through fake information giving by Al-Qaeda members and dodging death multiple times. After finding his compound, the legendary SEAL Team 6 is called upon to finally take Bin Laden down. I love this movie because it keeps you on the edge of your seat and tells the real story of how the U.S. assassinated the world's most infamous terrorist.</p>
