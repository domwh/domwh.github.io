	<h3>3. Inglorious Basterds</h3>

		<p>Everybody loves this Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, and so do I. One of the things that make it so special is the two different plots that merge together at the end. Brad Pitt plays Aldo Raine, an American Lieutenant who assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to kill Adolf Hitler and as many Nazis as possible. MÃ©lanie Laurent plays Shosanna Dreyfus, a Jew who is seeking revenge after her entire family was murdered. To defeat the third reich, both Aldo and Shosanna must deal with Colonel Hans Landa, a Nazi who has earned the name "The Jew Hunter" for a reason. Along with this amazing plot, Christoph Waltz, who portrays Hans Landa, puts on an absolutely legendary acting performance.</p>
	<h3>2. Goodfellas</h3>

		<p>Coming in at number 2 is a movie in everyone's top ten, Goodfellas. The Martin Scorsese film stars Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, a young gangster who is living the dream. Henry befriends fellow gangsters Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, and the three get into some serious trouble and serious cash. Henry's live style proves to be a little too much for his wife, Karen, and she becomes increasingly frustrated with him. This movie just doesn't get old, and the chaotic life of Henry Hill somehow makes you wish you were and weren't a gangster at the same time.</p>
	<h3>1. The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>

		<p>My favorite movie is Martin Scorsese's over the top, in your face, laugh out loud masterpiece The Wolf of Wall Street. The film follows the life of Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who is a successful stockbroker and salesman who later starts his own brokerage firm. Jordan makes millions and parties hard with his friends, but not all of his firms practices are legal. With Jordan's greed and drug addiction increasing more and more throughout the movie, reality is destined to catch up with him. This movie has a great plot, great production, and great acting from DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, and Margot Robbie. With all that combined it puts it at the top of the list of my favorite movies.</p>
