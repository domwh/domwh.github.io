	<h3>6. Saving Private Ryan</h3>

		<p>This Steven Spielberg movie certainly doesn't shy away from showing the harsh realities of World War 2. Captain John Miller, played by Tom Hanks, manages to stay alive during the grueling allied invasion of Normandy. He is sent to lead a small team of soldiers on a mission to find Private Ryan, who is missing in action after he jumped into Normandy with the 101st Airborne. Out of all of the World War 2 movies ever made, this one clearly stands out to me as the best.</p>
	<h3>5. The Departed</h3>

		<p>Martin Scorsese's first and only Oscar win comes in at number 5 for me. Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, want to be a cop in the Boston Police Department. The problem is that his family is well known for partaking in crime throughout the city, and Billy is only offered one job because of this. He goes under cover and infiltrates crime boss Frank Costello's crew, hoping to gather enough information to put him in prison for life. But Costello has a mole of his own in the Boston PD, so who's identity will be discovered first? This movie keeps me on the edge of my seat and has an incredible plot, making it a clear favorite for me.</p>
	<h3>4. American Sniper</h3>

		<p>This Clint Eastwood's film follows the life of Legendary Navy SEAL Sniper Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper. During his four tours to Iraq, Chris racks up 160 confirmed kills, the most by any sniper in U.S. history. This doesn't come without a cost however, as Chris's home life starts to fall apart as the stress of the war starts affecting him. After he leaves the navy, Chris is murdered on a shooting range by a former marine. I love this movie because it honors a true American hero.</p>
